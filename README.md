<br/>

A graduate student and indie game developer interested in immersive storytelling and user-centered experience design. <br/>

I've loved games since childhood, but after encountering the masterpiece God of War—which achieved high-quality storytelling through the fusion of game design and engineering—I became captivated by the charm of games perfected at the intersection of technology and art.<br/>

With the expectation that understanding game UX will enhance the quality of immersive narratives for players, I am currently researching UX design to improve game immersion and convenience at Sogang University's Department of Art & Technology.<br/>

Recently, I discovered Cassette Futurism and am planning an alternate history game set against the backdrop of modern and contemporary Korean history.<br/>
